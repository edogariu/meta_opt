things i needed to change to get it to work

- change `get_raw_datasets()` in input_pipeline to actually just use tfds.load, including adding vocab_path and config to args
- change all the imports
- add __init__.py to wmt folder
- move configs/default.py out to wmt/default.py
- changed vocab_path to config.vocab_path in get_wmt_datasets (the argument to make the tokenizer)
- added get_mini_config to default.py
